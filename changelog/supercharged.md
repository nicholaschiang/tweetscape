![Favorite folders](/ss/supercharged.webp)

## Favorite folders

We've added folders to your Favorites section to keep it tidy and well-organized. You'll see the option to create a folder by hovering over the word Favorites in your sidebar. To add favorites to a folder, open the folder and then drag and drop them in. You can open favorites from your sidebar or with the shortcut `O` then `F`.
